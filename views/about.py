st.write("""
Traditional heuristic models (like Last-Touch) are rule-based and arbitrary. They attribute 100% of sales credit 
to the final touchpoint (e.g., Direct visits or Paid Search ads). Consequently, companies often cut budgets 
for top-of-funnel discovery channels (like Facebook or Instagram ads), which starve the lead generation pipeline 
and lead to a reduction in overall revenue.

This project implements a probabilistic attribution engine to:
1. Reconstruct chronological user touchpoint paths.
2. Evaluate traditional models against a **Markov Chain Model**.
3. Calculate the **Removal Effect** of each channel to find its true conversion assist-value.
4. Optimize budget allocation to maximize conversions for the same marketing spend.

    - **First Touch**: Assigns 100% of the conversion credit to the first marketing channel the customer interacted with. Best for measuring top-of-funnel brand awareness.
    - **Last Touch**: Assigns 100% of the conversion credit to the final marketing channel the customer clicked before purchasing. Highly biased towards bottom-of-funnel channels.
    - **Linear**: Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints in the customer journey path.

    - **Time Decay**: Assigns credit exponentially based on time proximity to the conversion event. Recent clicks receive higher credit than early interactions (using a 7-day half-life).
    - **Position-Based (U-Shaped)**: Assigns 40% of credit to the first touch, 40% to the last touch, and splits the remaining 20% equally among any intermediate touchpoints.

    Let $S = \\{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n\\}$ be the set of states. We calculate the transition probability from state $i$ to state $j$ as:
    $$P(j | i) = \\frac{\\text{Count}(i \\rightarrow j)}{\\sum_k \\text{Count}(i \\rightarrow k)}$$

    The transition matrix $P$ is structured in canonical absorbing form:
    $$P = \\begin{pmatrix} Q & R \\\\ 0 & I \\end{pmatrix}$$
    where:
    - $Q$ is an $M \\times M$ matrix representing probabilities of moving between transient marketing channels.
    - $R$ is an $M \\times 2$ matrix representing probabilities of moving from transient channels to absorbing exits (Conversion, Null).
    - $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix for absorbing states.

    st.markdown("""
    Using absorbing Markov chain algebra, the **Fundamental Matrix** $N$ is calculated as:
    $$N = (I - Q)^{-1}$$
    where $N_{i, j}$ represents the expected number of times a customer is in transient state $j$ starting from transient state $i$.

    The probability of absorption (ending up in conversion) starting from transient states is matrix $B$:
    $$B = N \\times R = (I - Q)^{-1} R$$
    
    The baseline conversion probability $p_{\\text{base}}$ is the value of starting at `(Start)` and reaching `(Conversion)`.

    To calculate the importance of channel $X$, we set all transitions entering $X$ to transition instead to `(Null)`. We then recompute the blocked conversion probability $p_{\\text{blocked}}$. The **Removal Effect (RE)** is:
    $$\\text{RE}_X = \\frac{p_{\\text{base}} - p_{\\text{blocked}}}{p_{\\text{base}}}$$
